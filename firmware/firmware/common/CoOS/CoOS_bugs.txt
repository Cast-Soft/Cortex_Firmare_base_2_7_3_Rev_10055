Bug #3
Issue: sometimes, approximately 1-2 beacon from 10 during 24 hours stop transmitting.
Results:
  After 2 weeks research and closing in seems following happens:
call to CoWaitForSingleFlag() with timeout value of 1 never returned.
Task never gets called again.
Appears that task is in TASK_READY state, but it is not in TCBRdy list,
not in delay list.
Seems following happens:
1) Task1 calls CoWaitForSingleFlag with predefined timeout.
   It locks, marks flags to be set, inserts task in DlyList (setting TASK_WAITING status), 
   then unlocks, requesting scheduler!
2) TaskRadioTx comes, calls CoSetFlag, 
   It sets flag, then locks, removes task from Dlylist (not touching task status) and unlocks.
3) Task1 again locks, reset flags, then unlocks.
4) Scheduler comes: Task1 has status TASK_WAITING (supposed to be in DlyList, but is not there), so it is not supposed to be in TCBRdy list,
   scheduler removes it from ready list and sets TASK_RUNNING.
Now we have lost our task and will not get spins: it is not in TCBRdy, nor in Dlylist.

Status: trying to confirm.
